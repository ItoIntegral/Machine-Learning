# Machine-Learning




This repository contains code for a study that investigates machine learning algorithms for credit risk assessment using the German Credit dataset. The models used include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Deep Learning with TensorFlow. The problem of class imbalance in the dataset is addressed using cost-sensitive learning.
